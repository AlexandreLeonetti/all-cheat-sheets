If you want one linear order, here it is:
1️⃣ Kubernetes (prod & troubleshooting)
cheatsheet +

You must be able to answer without hesitation:
Why a pod is CrashLoopBackOff
Why a pod is Pending
How you debug networking issues
Readiness vs liveness
ConfigMap vs Secret
Rolling update failures
Basic HPA logic


2️⃣ Ansible
Because:
Cherry Pick (Ansible)
CyberTee (Ansible)
Anthos mission (Terraform + Ansible)
Focus ONLY on practical Ansible:
inventory (static is enough)
playbooks vs roles
idempotency (VERY important)
handlers
templates (Jinja2 basics)
when Ansible vs Terraform


3️⃣ Helm + ArgoCD (GitOps)
This is the bridge between DevOps and Platform roles.
Must know:
Helm values vs templates
How Helm + ArgoCD work together
GitOps principles (source of truth)
What breaks when ArgoCD sync fails

4️⃣ OpenShift (differences & constraints)
Focus on differences, not learning everything:
OpenShift vs Kubernetes
SCC (why pods fail)
Routes vs Ingress
oc vs kubectl
OpenShift 3 → 4 migration concepts
5️⃣ GCP (Kubernetes-centric)
6️⃣ AWS (light refresh)
7️⃣ Anthos (conceptual only)
8️⃣ FastAPI / Spring Boot
9️⃣ React / RN
🔟 Algo & DS
